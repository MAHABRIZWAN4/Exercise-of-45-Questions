/* Q20. Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, 
rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list 
containing these items.*/

let rivers:string[] = ["Indus","Ravi","Jhelum","Chenab"]
//making list by using forEach
rivers.forEach(names => {
